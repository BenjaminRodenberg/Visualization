# ODE App
This app visualizes, how different ODE Solvers solve different ODEs. The user can interactively change stepwidth and starting value, as well as choose from 3 different solvers (explicit Euler, implicit Euler, implicit midpoint rule) and 2 different ODEs (Dahlquist test equation and logistic differential equation).
