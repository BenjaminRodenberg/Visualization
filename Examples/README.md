# Examples
In this folder we store examples from all over the web. Those (more or less minimal) examples are supposed to help understanding the way the bokeh environment is working.

### Sources
The examples in this folder are NOT my work, they have been copied from the following open sources on git:
- [Official examples of the bokeh development team on GitHub](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/tree/master/examples)
Additional references are given in the specific folder.
