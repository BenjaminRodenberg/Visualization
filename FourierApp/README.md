# Fourier
Information provided in the [documentation](https://github.com/BenjaminRueth/Visualization/blob/master/FourierApp/Doc/fourierSpecification.pdf)

One can also enter any function for computing its Fourier series. For the input we use `sympy` syntax.

## ToDos
- [x] Change structure of the App in the style of the sliders example
- [x] Update to Bokeh 0.11
- [ ] Add controls for setting periodicity and interval (e.g. [-pi,pi] or [0,2pi] or [0,2])
- [ ] Improve GUI
- [ ] make sympy input faster (see convolution app as an example implementation)
- [ ] Add code for embedding, such that the app can be published on the internet.
- [ ] Implement dynamic printing of analytical expression in embedded html
