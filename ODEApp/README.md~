# ODE App
This app visualizes, how different ODE Solvers solve different ODEs. The user can interactively change stepwidth and starting value, as well as choose from 3 different solvers (explicit Euler, implicit Euler, implicit midpoint rule) and 2 different ODEs (Dahlquist test equation and logistic differential equation).

## Running
Enter 
```
$ bokeh-server --script ode_app.py
```
in bash to run the app. Then enter
```
http://localhost:5006/bokeh/ode
```
in your browser to use the app in it.

##ToDos
- [x] Change structure of the App in the style of the sliders example
- [x] Improve GUI (see [here](https://www-m11.ma.tum.de/en/karpfing/buecher/videoanimationen/bokehunderconstruction/), esp. plot of reference solution, legend entries)
- [ ] Add code for embedding, such that the app can be published on the internet.
