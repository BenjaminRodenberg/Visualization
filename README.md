Webbased visualization for math content via Bokeh

This Repository contains different prototypes for WebApps for the visualization of math content for lectures at TUM (Technische Universität München).

Please also read the pdf file in Fourier/fourierSpecification.pdf on how to use the fourier app.

## ToDos
### On particular Apps
- [ ] Find out how to bring an app to the internet ( see [Gallery](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html) ). How to get from an app like [Examples/Stocks](https://github.com/BenjaminRueth/Visualization/tree/master/Examples/ExampleStocks) to an app running in the internet?
- [ ] Finalize [BoundaryValApp](https://github.com/BenjaminRueth/Visualization/tree/master/BoundaryValApp)
- [ ] Finalize [ODEApp](https://github.com/BenjaminRueth/Visualization/tree/master/ODEApp)
- [ ] Finalize [FourierApp](https://github.com/BenjaminRueth/Visualization/tree/master/FourierApp)
- [ ] Find nice additional visualisations
### Local machine
- [x] Publish some html from local machine
- [ ] Find out how to bring an app to the internet running on the local machine ( see [Examples/Stocks](https://www.google.de/) )
